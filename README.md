## 🔁 Project Background

This website project builds upon a **Figma-based UI redesign** we created earlier as part of our **ICT Lab Final Project in 1st semester**, under the team name **JAWA** (Junaid, Abbas, Awais, Abdullah).

That design project is available here:  
🔗 [UMT App & Portal – Redesigned UI (Figma Project)](https://github.com/Abbas192006/umt-app-ui-redesign)

It laid the foundation for our frontend development practice and inspired this implementation.

## 🧠 Note

This is a **static, front-end-only project**, ideal for learning, practice, and showcasing UI skills.  
It is not connected to any backend or database.

The project was created during our summer break after the 2nd semester, with help from **AI tools like ChatGPT**, which supported us in debugging, layout improvement, and learning key web development concepts.

This is a **student-made project**, not affiliated with or officially representing UMT.  
It was developed purely for **academic growth and skill development**.
